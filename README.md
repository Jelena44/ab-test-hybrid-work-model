# A/B Experiment: Decision on Introducing One Work-from-Home Day

This project supports a business decision on whether to introduce one remote work day per week by evaluating its impact on employee performance and job satisfaction.

## 📊 Project Overview

An A/B experiment was conducted with 40 employees divided into two groups:
- **Control group**: Employees working entirely on-site.
- **Experimental group**: Employees working from home one day per week.

Both groups were matched based on department, age, gender, tenure, salary, education level, and organizational level. The experiment lasted 2 months.

The goal was to determine whether implementing one work-from-home day per week would be a justified organizational decision, based on:
- **Employee performance** (as rated by managers)
- **Job satisfaction** (self-assessed by employees)

An independent t-test was applied to test group differences, with additional tests for normality (Shapiro-Wilk), variance equality (Levene), and effect size (Cohen’s d).

## 🧪 Main Findings

- The hybrid group had **significantly higher performance scores** and **greater job satisfaction**.
